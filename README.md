# Hearthdump

Dumps Hearthstone log files generated by the [Hearth Log client](https://github.com/chippydip/HearthLog) to a more easily readable JSON format.

## Getting started

You need the protobuf library. You can get this on OS X from homebrew:

	brew install protobuf
	
Linux users can probably find it in their distro's package manager. Windows users - I am not sure!

Then:

	npm install
	
Compile the protos:

	./compile-protos
	
And finally:

	coffee index.coffee path/to/log.hsl
	
The JSON output will be printed to stdout.
